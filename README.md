Hello!

Welcome to my portfolio. This is a small side project that I am working on just to keep myself accountable and make sure I get a better understanding of frontend development. Feel free to check it out!

My Goals:
* push code or tangible changes on a daily basis to my portfolio
* have a complete portfolio by the end of 2023
* have my portfolio give an accurate, general representation of myself
