            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>I'm a passionate third-year Computer Science major at San Jos√© State University, delving into the world of technology with a particular focus on frontend development. Complementing my studies, I've chosen to minor in Digital Media Art, exploring the intersection of creativity and code.</p>
            <p>While I thrive on coding challenges and creating seamless user experiences, I find balance and inspiration in various interests. Outside the digital realm, I indulge in my love for art, particularly drawing intricate portraits. My feline companion, Mocha, often becomes both my muse and distraction during these creative pursuits.</p>
            <p>Music serves as a backdrop to my life, sparking creativity and adding rhythm to my coding sessions. I relish moments with friends, cherishing conversations over meals and exploring different cuisines. These experiences not only recharge me but also influence my approach to problem-solving and design.</p>
